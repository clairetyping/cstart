/*Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:
Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Follow up:
Could you solve it without converting the integer to a string?
Be aware of overflow when you reverse the integer.
*/

/*reminder
1.exclude the negative numbers from the begining.
2.be aware of the type of variable, to set as long to avoid overflow
3.return i == temp; do not need to complete the sentence and it will return the bool result, false or true.
